# AURA

# Notes

Make sure to build the program at `./ros2_ws/`by running:
- `colcon build --symlink-install`
- `source install/setup.bash`
So it automatically builds when there are file updates. However, you need to redo all these when creating/deleting files.

To run the setup test launch script: `ros2 launch aura test_launch.py`
